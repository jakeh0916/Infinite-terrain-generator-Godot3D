# Infinite Terrain 3D

## What is this
This is a small, simple infinite terrain generator written in a somewhat ill-advised style.

## What does it do
It provides a class called "TerrainGenerator" (and "TerrainGeneratorAsync" for better performance at the cost of a thread)
which can be instantiated, like usual, with the .new() function. Once instantiated, add the object to the scene tree, and it
will generate customizable terrain around its "Target."

Generally, there isn't much useful here, but it is somewhat cool to look at.

## How do I run it
1. Download the project as a zip
2. Unzip the file
3. Use the Godot launcher to launch the project
4. Run from the Godot application

The project has not been compiled to an .exe
