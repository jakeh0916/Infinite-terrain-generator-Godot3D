# Infinite terrain generation for Godot 3D

### What is this
This is a small, simple infinite terrain generator.

### What does it do
It provides a class called "TerrainGenerator" (and "TerrainGeneratorAsync" for better performance at the cost of an additional thread) which can be created with the .new() function. Once created, add the object to the scene tree, and it will generate customizable terrain around the position of a 3D "target."

### How do I run it
1. Download the project as a zip
2. Unzip the file
3. Use the Godot launcher to launch the project
4. Run from the Godot application
