# Infinite Terrain 3D

## What is this
This is a small, simple infinite terrain generator.

## What does it do
It provides a class called "TerrainGenerator" (and "TerrainGeneratorAsync" for better performance at the cost of an additional thread)
which can be instantiated, like usual, with the .new() function. Once instantiated, add the object to the scene tree, and it
will generate customizable terrain around its "Target."

There isn't much here, but it is kinda cool to look at.

## How do I run it
1. Download the project as a zip
2. Unzip the file
3. Use the Godot launcher to launch the project
4. Run from the Godot application
